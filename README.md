# The Problem Solved by This App and Why It Needs Solving
The problem that this app solves has arisen from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Gyms have been shut down for months.  This leads to two problems.  Gym goers can only train at home with the limited equipment they have.  This has increased the demand for home gym equipment and lead to equipment being sold out in most stores or the price has been prohibitively inflated.  Gym goers need gear to train at home and they can’t get it.  They also only need the equipment while restrictions are still in effect and gyms are closed.
The second problem is from the perspective of gym owners.  While restrictions are in place a gym owner has gym equipment just sitting there unused.  If they financed the equipment, they still must make repayments and they still must pay rent for the gym building.  A gym owner would be able to offset some of their overhead costs if they could hire out their unused gym equipment while restrictions are still in effect.
# Weight It Out
#### Purpose
The purpose of the Weight It Out two-way marketplace app is to solve the problems mentioned above for both Gym goers and gym owners.  A Gym goer can find equipment on Weight It Out and hire it a month at a time.  This means they don’t waste money buying equipment they only need temporarily.  Gym owners can list equipment for rent on Weight It Out that would otherwise sit there unused during restrictions and at least make some money.
